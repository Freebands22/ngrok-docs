## Behavior

By default, ngrok will already terminate TLS connections for you even if you do not explicitly use this action in your Traffic Policy. If you specify this action in your Traffic Policy without any configuration, you will see no change in behavior for your endpoints.

### Changing Supported TLS Versions

You can use this action to specify the minimum and maximum TLS versions that your endpoint will support for incoming connections. By default, your endpoint will support TLS versions 1.2 and 1.3. If you want to support different versions of TLS, you can use the `min_version` and `max_version` fields in the configuration. Clients using an unsupported version of TLS will receive a handshake error.
